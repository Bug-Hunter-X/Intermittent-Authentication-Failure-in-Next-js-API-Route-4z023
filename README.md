# Intermittent Authentication Failure in Next.js API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where authentication in a Next.js API route fails intermittently, even with seemingly consistent requests. The issue is that `unstable_getServerSession` sometimes returns `null` even when a user is logged in, leading to an unexpected 401 Unauthorized response.

## Bug Description

An API route using `unstable_getServerSession` for authentication exhibits unpredictable behavior.  It correctly identifies the user session in some requests but fails in others, returning a 401 error despite the user being logged in.  There are no apparent patterns in the failed requests; they appear random.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `authOptions` are correctly configured. Additional logging and error handling are also added for improved debugging.
